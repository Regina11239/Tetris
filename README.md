# Tetris
In thie program, I created a modified version of the game Tetris. 

It has a forest theme with matching colors. Gives a beautiful scene while the players play the classic game.

After downloading all the files, execute TetrisGame.java to play the game. 

Note: This program is created with Java Applet, which is now deprecated in the new versions. I recommend running it in Java version 7 or 8. 

Below are 2 screenshots of the game, includes the title page(image 1) and game screen(image 2).

Program finished in 2021.
