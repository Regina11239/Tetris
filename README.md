# Tetris
In thie program, I created a modified version of the game Tetris. 

It has a forest theme with matching colors. Gives a beautiful scene while the players play the classic game.

After downloading all the files, execute TetrisGame.java to play the game. 


Below are some screenshots of the game, includes the title page(image 1) and game screen(image 2).

Program finished in 2021.
